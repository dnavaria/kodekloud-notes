# pushd & popd
- push directory to directory stack => `pushd <directory>`
- pops last pushed directory and change directory => `popd`

# whatis, man & appropos
- Print one line description of what a command does => `whatis <command>`
- Print detailed description of what a command does => `man <command>`
- search the manual page names and descriptions => `appropos <command>`

# Environment Variables
- To make env var in linux persistent over subsequent logins and reboot add them to `~/.profile or ~/.pam_environment`
- Adding path to path variable => `export PATH=$PATH:<new path>`
- Customizing PS1 variable => `PS1="[\d \t \u@\h:\w ] $"`
- `echo 'PS1="[\d]\u@\h:\w$"' >> ~/.profile`

- Change Shell => `sudo chsh -s /bin/<shell type> <username>`

# Linux - Working with Hardware
- To understand this, let's take an example of a USB disk to bbe used in the system.
- As soon as the disk is attached to the system, a corresponding device driver which is part of the kernel space, detects the stage change and generates an event.
- This event, which is called uevnent is then sent to the user-space device manager daemon called udev.
- The udev service is then reponsible for dynamically creating a device node associated with the newly attached drive in the /dev file system.
- Once this process is complete, the newly attached disk should be visible under /dev file system.

## Tools to get detailed information about hardware components
- `dmesg` => A tool used to display messages from an area of the kernel called the ring buffer.
	- When a linux os boots up, there are numerous messages generated by the kernel that appear on the display screen.
	- These messages also contain logs from the hardware devices that the kernel detects and provide a good indication whether it is able to configure them.
	- Wec can redirect the output of dmesg using less or search for specific keyworkds using grep.
- `udevadm` => The udevadm utility is a management tool for udev.
	- The udevadm info command queries the udev database for device information
	- Here we are querying the hard disk attached to the system.
		- `udevadm info --query=path --name=/dev/sda5`
	- `udevadm monitor` => The udevadm monitor command listens to the kernel uevents.
		- Upon detecting an event it prints details such device path and device name on the screen.
		- This command is quite handy to determine the details of newly attached or removed devices
- `lspci` => (peripheral component interconnect) The lspci command stands for list PCI. This command is used to display information about all PCI devices that are configured in the system.
	- Examples of PCI devices are:
		- Ethernet cards
		- raid contollers
		- video cards
		- wireless adapters that directly attach to PCI slots in the motherboard of the computer
- `lsblk` => This command list information about block devices.
	- sda => physical disk
	- vda => virtual disk
	- Here the `type disk` refers to the whole physical disk and the `type partition` refers to a resuable disk space carved out of the physcial disk.
	- In the command output there are also major and minor numbers associated with each device.
		- The major number which is on the left-hand side of the colon identifies the type of device driver associated with the device.
			- Number 8 refers to a block sdisk device.
		- The minor number is used to differentiate amongst devices that are similar and share the same major number
			- Numbers `0 - n` help identify different partitions for the disk`sda
	- Major Number 1 => RAM
	- Major Number 3 => Hard Disk or CD ROM
	- Major Number 1 => PARALLEL PRINTERS
	- Major Number 1 => SCSI DISK
- `lscpu` => To display information about cpu architechture use the lscpu command.
	- This command provides detailed information such as 
		- the CPU architechture,
		- Number of cores 
		- Threads
		- Model and more
		- CPU = Sockets x Cores x Threads
- `lsmem` => The lsmem command can be sued to list the available memory in the system.
	- Use this command with the `--summary` flag to print the summary
	- To get comprehensive output run it without the above flag
	
- `free` => Another command to show information about the total versus used memory in the system.
	- Use the `-m` to display results in MB, `-k` in KB, `-g` in GB
- `lshw` => The lshw is atool to extract detailed information on the entire hardware configuration of the machine.
	- It can report exact memory configuration, firmware version, mainboard configuration, CPU version, speed, cache configuration, bus speed and more.
